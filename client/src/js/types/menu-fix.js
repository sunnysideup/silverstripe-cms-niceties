/**
 * Side menu labels were dissappearing
 * when editing pages in the CMS. This bug was due to the 3rd party library
 * thinking the side menu was collapsed then failing to properly collapse the sidemenu
 * The bug is present in the vendor folder so this script sets specific cookies to trick the 3rd
 * party code into thinking the side menu is always pulled out
